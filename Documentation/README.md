# Documentation

This folder contains all design, research, testing, and evaluation documentation for the XR Kindle Redesign project - an immersive VR reading experience developed across three iterative prototypes.

## Project Overview
This project reimagines Amazon Kindle as an XR application, leveraging VR's spatial capabilities to create immersive, customizable reading environments. The design evolved through three prototypes:

Prototype 1: Horizontal prototype testing spatial navigation and book selection in 3D library spaces

Prototype 2: VR implementation with Meta Quest, testing physics-based book grabbing, poke-interactive audio controls, and workspace customization

Prototype 3: Advanced VR-native interactions featuring miniaturized portable libraries, dynamic book scaling, and portal-based environment teleportation

**Testing Plans**

Comprehensive testing protocols for each prototype iteration:

Prototype 1 Testing Plan: Spatial navigation and book selection usability testing

Prototype 2 Testing Plan: VR-native interactions with think-aloud protocol and post-interview questions

Prototype 3 Testing Plan: Advanced spatial manipulation testing with mixed-methods approach (think-aloud + interview + survey)

Research summaries with academic references supporting design decisions

**Evaluation Reports**

User testing results, data analysis, and design iteration documentation:

Prototype 1 Evaluation: 5-participant testing results validating spatial navigation (100% task completion, 8.5/10 intuitiveness)

Prototype 2 Evaluation: Single-participant VR testing with technical challenges and critical locomotion insights

Prototype 3 Evaluation: 5-participant comprehensive testing validating mini library concept while revealing book-world integration needs

Final Reflection: Cross-prototype analysis examining methodological evolution and concept validation

Each iteration informed the next, demonstrating the role of rapid prototyping in validating XR interaction patterns and uncovering user expectations in immersive environments.
